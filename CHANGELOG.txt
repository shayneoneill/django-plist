Changelog
=========

- Added as_plist keyword argument to render_array shortcut to control 
  serialization of objects without altering Model classes, see updated
  documentation in docs/overview.markdown.
- Tests: Added test suites for shortcut functions and generic views
- Bug: Dictionary keys are now properly escaped as #PCDATA
- Bug: render_dictionary() rendered None as a string. None is now
  rendered as an empty dictionary.

0.3 - 2009-10-28
