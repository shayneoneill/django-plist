Changelog
=========

0.5 - 2010-01-19
----------------
- Added as_plist keyword argument to render_array shortcut to control 
  serialization of objects without altering Model classes, see updated
  documentation in docs/overview.markdown.
- Tests: Added test suites for shortcut functions and generic views
- Tests: Added Cocoa integration tests in cocoa_tests/. These require a 
  functional GCC/Cocoa suite to run.
- Bug: Dictionary keys are now properly escaped as #PCDATA
- Bug: render_dictionary() rendered None as a string. None is now
  rendered as an empty dictionary.
- Bug: datetime.datetime objects should not output fractions of seconds.
- Bug: datetime.date objects should render with T00:00:00, Cocoa fails to 
  read the property list otherwise.
- Bug: datetime.time objects now render as string, Cocoa apps barf on the
  <date>HH:MM:SS</date> elements.

0.4 - 2009-10-29
----------------
- Added missing files to Manifest.in which caused build errors when installing
  with setup.py
- XML data is now properly escaped in <string>

0.3 - 2009-10-28
----------------
- Raises an error when rendering fails, i.e. when the object is not a model,
  does not have a as_plist() method or is not a basic type.
